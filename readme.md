# A
## Attention
- [Attention Is All You Need](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-%0Aneed.pdf) (*Paper*)

# B
## Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
- [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07909) (*Paper*): Proposed to use BPE in ML. Source code is also [provided in GitHub](https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt).
- [Byte Pair Encoding](https://leimao.github.io/blog/Byte-Pair-Encoding/) (*blog*): Covers step-by-step implementation with examples.

# C
## Connectionist temporal classification (CTC)
CTC is used to train deep neural networks in speech recognition, handwriting recognition and other sequence problems.
- [Connectionist temporal classification: labelling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural networks.](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1292048/file.pdf) (*Original paper*)
- [Sequence Modeling With CTC](https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/) (*blog*): A good explanation with respect to speech recognition.
- [An Intuitive Explanation of Connectionist Temporal Classification](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-connectionist-temporal-classification-3797e43a86c) (*blog*): Discussed from the hand writing recognition view.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) (*blog*): An in depth discussion on CNN and its operations. Includes both visual and mathematical concepts.
