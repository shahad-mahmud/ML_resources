- [Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and Subword Tokenization](https://blog.shahadmahmud.com/byte-pair-encoding-and-subword-tokenization/) (*blog*): Why subword tokenization is important is explained with step by step explanation and implementation.

# C
## Connectionist temporal classification (CTC)
CTC is used to train deep neural networks in speech recognition, handwriting recognition and other sequence problems.
- [Connectionist temporal classification: labelling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural networks.](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1292048/file.pdf) (*Original paper*)
